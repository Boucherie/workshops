# Why animate?

* why do we use animation in UI in the first place?
* when we think of animation within UI, we might imagine things like Google's overlay dramatic examples of things morphing from one shape to another as demo'ed in their Material Design system. Or maybe even the impossibly complex, basically animated video renders of transformative flows folks like to share on Dribbble.
* when you imagine animation within this context… this animations feel superficial… like exist almost entirely for the 'ooh ahhs'
* I'd argue that it's main goal is to improve communication
* static UI changes can be jarring and very confusing
* especially if the new UI patterns are unfamiliar
